# AES Implementation

An implementation of AES-128/AES-196/AES-256 encryption

This project was built only by refering to course materials and by following 
the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197
https://cs465.byu.edu/static/pubs/fips-197.pdf

Language: C

To Compile: 
- use a C compiler (gcc)
- in command prompt navigte to folder containing AES-Implementation.c
- execute the following command '$ gcc –Wall AES-Implementation.c –o aes'
this will make the program binary

The program takes no arguments but helpful comments are included in the code 
to show where to place the text you want to encrypt/decrypt

* when changing key sizes, make sure to update the constants at the head of the file
